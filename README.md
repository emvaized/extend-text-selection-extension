# Extend Text Selection - Firefox Addon

## Overview
Extend Text Selection is a Firefox addon that enhances your browsing experience by adding a context menu and keyboard shortcut to extend current text selection. It might be really handy in specific use cases when really long text is embeded in small scrollable container on the page. 

On each iteration it goes one level up in the elements tree, for example: `word` -> `paragraph` -> `block of text` -> `whole article` -> `whole page`. What exactly is going to be selected on the next step depends on how the page is structured. You might need to trigger it several times to achieve the desired level of selection.

This addon is super tiny and doesn't affect performance at all, but it will be there when you need it. 

## How to use it
- From the right click context menu of the text selection
- Using the keyboard shortcut (default: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>)
